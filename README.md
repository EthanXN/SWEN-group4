Product Vision Statement:

Our product is a web-based food and beverage ordering system that allows users to browse a catalog of available items, collect selected items into a personal basket, and finalize their order in a simple and intuitive way.

The system supports two roles: an Owner (admin) who manages the catalog by adding, editing, and removing items, and Helpers (customers) who can search, filter, and collect items before committing their selection.

The goal of this application is to provide a clean, reliable, and persistent ordering experience where user selections are securely saved across sessions, while demonstrating real-world team-based software development using modern full-stack technologies.
